Hello. My name is Mike Sedelmeyer. I currently work in financial planning and analysis at Harvard University. In previous roles, I have tackled growth and performance challenges in finance, operations, and technology in organizations as diverse as the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.emc.com/" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a> (now DELL EMC).

I combine my experience in analytics, consulting, and finance to help guide organizations toward improved operations and more effective decision-making.

You can learn more about my background [on this page](past.md), find my resume <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedelmeyer/" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>, and see examples of my analytics and development work <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedelmeyer/" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.
