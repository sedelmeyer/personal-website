Hello. My name is Mike Sedelmeyer. I currently work in financial planning and analysis at Harvard University. In previously roles, I have tackled growth and performance challenges in finance, operations, and technology in organizations as diverse as the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.emc.com/" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a> (now DELL EMC).

I combine my experience in finance, program management, analytics, and consulting to help guide organizations toward improved operations and more effective decision-making.

You can find my resume on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedelmeyer/" target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a>.


## An Unusual Career Path

I grew up in upstate New York. I was in college studying painting at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a> when I traveled west for a summer of <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyfisherysalmon.main" target="_blank">commercial fishing in Alaska</a>. This experience left me with a taste for adventure. After college I traveled west again and spent five years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire" target="_blank">fighting forest fires for the U.S. Federal Government</a>. During those five years I spent my winters with my wife in New Orleans and later upstate New York until I followed her permanently to Cambridge, Massachusetts. There I spent several years working for Harvard University, both administratively and as a teaching assistant in statistics. I eventually enrolled in graduate school at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>, where I earned dual <a href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/" target="_blank">MBA</a> and <a href="https://www.masspolicy.org/" target="_blank">Public Policy</a> master's degrees. This led to my work in operations and systems at <a href="https://www.jstart.org/" target="_blank">Jumpstart</a>, a national non-profit based in Boston, my work in finance at <a href="http://www.ford.com" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and my several years at <a href="https://www.emc.com/en-us/services/professional-services/index.htm" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a>, a global technology firm now owned by Dell Technologies, where I supported strategic programs and eventually managed the companyâ€™s consulting business with two financial industry global customers in New York City.

## Right Now

My wife and I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I have recently returned to work at Harvard University after taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones.

A couple things keeping me busy right now include:

- Documenting family history and <a href= "https://github.com/sedelmeyer" target="_blank">building custom tools with Postgres, Flask, and Python</a> to manage my genealogical data and archive files, and

- Improving my proficiency with Python and R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

## Strange But True Facts

1. I am good with a chainsaw and have experience felling trees 36+ inches in diameter.
1. I can strip a bicycle down to its frame and bearings and rebuild it part-by-part.
1. I spent a year rappelling from of helicopters during my work as a wildland firefighter.
