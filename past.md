# An Unusual Career Path

I grew up in upstate New York. I was in college studying painting at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a> when I traveled west for a summer of <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyfisherysalmon.main" target="_blank">commercial fishing in Alaska</a>. This experience left me with a taste for adventure. After college I traveled west again and spent five years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire" target="_blank">fighting forest fires for the U.S. Federal Government</a>. During those five years I spent my winters with my wife in New Orleans and later upstate New York until I followed her permanently to Cambridge, Massachusetts. There I spent several years working for Harvard University, both administratively and as a teaching assistant in statistics. I eventually enrolled in graduate school at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>, where I earned dual <a href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/" target="_blank">MBA</a> and <a href="https://www.masspolicy.org/" target="_blank">Public Policy</a> master's degrees. This led to my work in operations and systems at <a href="https://www.jstart.org/" target="_blank">Jumpstart</a>, a national non-profit based in Boston, my work in finance at <a href="http://www.ford.com" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and my several years at <a href="https://www.emc.com/en-us/services/professional-services/index.htm" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a>, a global technology firm now owned by Dell Technologies, where I supported strategic programs and eventually managed the companyâ€™s consulting business with two financial industry global customers in New York City.
