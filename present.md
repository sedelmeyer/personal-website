# Right Now

My wife and I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I have recently returned to work at Harvard University after taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones.

A couple things keeping me busy right now include:

- Improving my proficiency with Python for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, most recently completing the courses [CS109a](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/) and [APMTH 207](https://am207.github.io/2018fall/) offered through Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

- Rebuilding and customizing a vintage Dahon Classic III folding bike, originally built in 1987.

- Rebuilding this site [to simplify ongoing maintenance](./articles/about-this-website) so I can more easily update and add content, while wasting far less time on web-design tasks.
