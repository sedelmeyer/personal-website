## Right Now

My wife and I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I have recently returned to work at Harvard University after taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones.

A couple things keeping me busy right now include:

- Documenting family history and <a href= "https://github.com/sedelmeyer" target="_blank">building custom tools with Postgres, Flask, and Python</a> to manage my genealogical data and archive files, and

- Improving my proficiency with Python and R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
