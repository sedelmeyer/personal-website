# website

## Summary
Files contained in this repository comprise my personal website, built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">the Jekyll parsing engine</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The site design is built upon <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">the Minima theme</a>, which I have heavily customized. 

This website can be viewed at the URL: http://www.sedelmeyer.net/

Check back. This is a work in progress and I am frequently updating the design and content.
