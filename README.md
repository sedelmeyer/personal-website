# My Personal Website

## Summary
Files contained in this repository comprise my personal website, built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">the Jekyll parsing engine</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The site design is built upon <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">the Minima theme</a>.

**This website can be viewed at: http://www.sedelmeyer.net/**

**Please note: I am currently in the process of rebuilding this site from a heavily customized theme to one that just runs on a near-stock version of minima.** I am doing this to reduce the maintenance and design overhead required to edit and add to this site.

TODO:
- add links to existing articles and projects
- write firefighting summary page
- write commercial fishing summary page
