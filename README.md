# website

## Summary
Files contained in this repository comprise my personal website, built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">the Jekyll parsing engine</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The site design is built upon <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">the Minima theme</a>, which I have heavily customized. 

**This website can be viewed at: http://www.sedelmeyer.net/**

**Please note: I am currently in the process of rebuilding this site and switching my rendering engine from Jekyll over to Pelican.**

My current understading is that, the simiplest way to ensure that github pages renders the site properly is that my `output` sub-directory should be the only thing committed to my `gh-pages` branch. The rest of the my repo (excluding `output`) should be committed to master as my source repo.
