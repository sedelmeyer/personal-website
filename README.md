# website

## Summary
Files contained in this repository comprise my personal website, built with the Jekyll parsing engine and hosted on GitHub Pages. The design is built upon the Minima theme, which I have heavily customized. 

This website can be viewed at the URL: http://www.sedelmeyer.net/

Check back. This is a work in progress and I am frequently updating the design and content.
