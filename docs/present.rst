Life at this moment
-------------------

My wife and I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I have recently returned to work at Harvard University after taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones.

Things keeping me busy right now
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Improving my proficiency with Python for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling:
    * most recently completing the courses `CS109a <https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/>`_ and `APMTH 207 <https://am207.github.io/2018fall/>`_ offered through Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences,
    * and putting new skills to use in personal projects `on GitHub <https://github.com/sedelmeyer>`_.

2. Rebuilding and customizing `a vintage Dahon Classic III folding bike <https://bootiebike.com/dahon/dahon.htm>`_, originally built in 1987.

Strange But True Facts
