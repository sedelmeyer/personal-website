Rebuilding a 1980's Dahon Classic III
=====================================

I was recently given a 1980's Dahon Classic III folding bike. The friend who gave it to me had been given the bike by one of his friends who had acquired it cheaply. However, after realizing how much a bike shop wanted to charge her to reburbish it back to a rideable condition, she had passed it on to him.
