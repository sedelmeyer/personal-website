I was recently given a 1980's Dahon classic folding bike. The friend who gave it to me had been given the bike by a friend of his who, in turn, had acquired it cheaply. However, after realizing how much a local bike shop wanted to charge to reburbish and tune the bike, my friend's friend had passed it on to my friend. My friend had no time to rebuild a bike, so he passed it on to me.

It had been several years since I had taken on a bicycle project. There was a period in my life when I'd refurbish a couple bikes a year. I had acquired a strange love for stripping bikes to their bearings and rebuilding them with new configurations. I was never a cyclist in the sense that I loved to go road riding or mountain biking, but I loved biking for transport and I loved rebuilding bikes. Through those projects, I acquired a particular taste for late-1980's to mid-1990's cycling technology.

When I received the Dahon Classic from my friend it provided me an opportunity to delve back into this hobby. It also provided me an opportunity to stop contemplating whether it would be worth purchasing a folding bike that I might be able to (a) keep at the office for use on midday or after-work excursions or (b) pack into the car on road trips. However, if I'm being honest, I had been contemplating getting a folding bike for more than a decade. I was well aware that I would never act on this curiosity unless the right project-bike came along. So it goes. I ended up with this Dahon folder. Now I will see if it is worth the work it has taken me to rebuild it.

A record of this bike's unique traits
-------------------------------------

This article logs my rebuilding of the bike. My true motivation for writing this is to provide a record of the unique specifications, measurements, and idosyncracies of this 1980's Dahon folder. For a model of bike so common as this one (cheap used Dahons of this era are typically easy to come by and they even appear to have attracted a cult following in parts of Southeast Asia), clear documentation regarding this bike's unique specifications is very difficult to find on the Internet. I did come by some forum discussions indicating that there had not always been this dearth of information. Apparently, there was someone who at one point had written extensively about these bikes. But it appears that this person's online writings had vanished some time ago.

Build experiences and important specifications
----------------------------------------------

To see a consolidated list of important specifications and measurements, you can jump to :ref:`the table <specs>` at the end of this article. Please note, that I am not entirely certain of the year in which this bike was manufactured, and so far I have been unable to locate the serial number anywhere on this bike's frame. However, if the year stamped on the Sturmey-Archer AW 3-speed hub shell is any indication, I at least know that the rear hub was manufactured in 1987. The `1987 Dahon user's manual`_ available as a pdf through the Dahon.com website also shows images of a bike very similar to mine, with the exception of a few specific components, which I am assuming varied based on model.

Frame design
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The early Dahon frames are a joy to look at. There's just something overtly mechanical or structural about their design. It is oddly similar to the look of a `Moulton folding bike`_ in that sense, but far, far more "low brow" than any Moulton will ever allow itself to be. I think it's the diagonal steer-tube strut that really rounds out the aesthetic. Granted, that diagonal strut is a weak point from a structural perspective, it lends a playfulness to the design that just seems to be missing from the later 16-inch wheeled Dahon classics that did away with that strut in favor of a locking quick-release bolt at the hinged base of the steering column.

Folding mechanics and joints
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Folding this bike is not particularly easy to do. It is actually the diagonal strut that makes it so difficult to do. In order to utilize the hinged frame, to fold the bike in half, the strut must first be decoupled from the steering column. This is accomplished by disengaging the spring-loaded used to secure the strut to the steering column. This involves turning the handlebars just so and then lifting up on the plastic knob attached to the pin, while attempting to slide the steering column laterally along the plane of its hinge, which is located just above the headset. It is a finicky first step in the folding process.

Once you are able to disengage the struct and fold it down backwards along the frame, you are free to disengage the hinge lock at the base of the frame, and then fold the front half of the frame back against itself.

This leaves you to question the correct order for the additional steps involved in folding this bike. At which point do you want to fold down the steering column? At which point do you want to undo the quick release bolts to press down the seat post and stem? If you still have the original folding drive-side crank on the bike, when do you want to unscrew and fold that crankarm up so that the pedal points inward? And, ever importantly, how should you have your cranks positioned such that the pedals do not get in your way?

Granted, there are step-by-step folding instructions in the `1987 Dahon user's manual`_, and examples published elsewhere online, it's still a tedious process for which it would be useful to have a third hand to make things a bit easier. That being said, I have favored ridability and comfort over folding ease while refurbishing this bike. For me, the small footprint of this bike (resulting from such small wheels) allows me to easily store it at home or in the office, and the ability to fold the bike frame in half (without lowering the seat post or stem) provides a compact enough size to easily fit it in a car, carry it onto a bus, or stand it tuched away in the corner of a room. But, I don't really do any of those things often, and I am glad not to, because disengaging the diagonal strut is a bit of a pain to do.

16-inch wheel sizing
""""""""""""""""""""
The wheels of the Dahon Classic are 16 inch. However, as things typically go with bicycle wheel-sizing, actual wheel size measurements, when expressed in inches, are open to interpretation. This bike's 16-inch wheels are of the "decimal" sizing variety. The original tires that came on this bike's rims were labeled 16 x 1.75. This means they had an ISO bead seat diameter of 305 mm. This is important to note, because as of my writing of this article (in the early-2020's), 305 mm rims and tires are hard to come by. Far more plentiful are rims and tires made for the 16 inch diameter used by Brompton folding bikes and many recumbant bikes. The Brompton's 16-inch wheels are of the "fractional" sizing variety. Therefore, a standard Brompton tire will read 16 x 1 3/8, and its ISO bead seat diameter will be 349 mm.

Changing standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From what I could gather while researching this topic, there was a time when the 305 mm diameter was more common on small-wheeled bikes, thus providing more choice among tires and rims. Back then, the 349 mm diameter wheel was a bit harder to come by and was typically used on higher-end and sportier folding bikes and recumbants. The 349 mm rims were typically narrower and were designed for narrower and higher-pressure "performance" tires. As it goes, most modern folding bikes are now designed with 20 inch tires (with the exception of Brompton-made bikes). While there are still some modern 16-inch folders using the 305 mm rim, they are few and far between, and the 16-inch market is largely dominated by Brompton and recumbants designed for what had previously been considered the "sportier" 349 mm rim. I suspect that, if I had been working on this project as recently as the late-2000's, there would have been a wider variety of 305 mm tires and rims available for me from which to choose.

For a little more background on wheel-sizing standards, an article well worth reading (as are most of his articles) is `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_.

Tire clearance
""""""""""""""

When I acquired this bike, it still had its original checkered-pattern 16 x 1.75 Hwa Fong brand tires on it. When I inspected these tires, I could see clear cracking along the tread in both tires, so I decided to replace them with a modern pair of puncture resistent touring/commuting tires. This is when I learned just how few tire companies manufactured versions of their more popular tires in 305 mm sizing. After a good deal of research, I ultimately found myself trying to decide between the 16 x 1.75 versions of Continental's  Ride Tour city tire and Schwalbe's Marathon tire. Both seemed to get good reviews and both had characteristics I desired. So, to save some cash, I ordered the lower cost Continental brand tires. It turns out however, that the Hwa Fong 16 x 1.75 inch tires already on the Dahon were closer in size to 1.5 inches wide (41 millimeters to be exact) instead of the 1.75 inches indicated by the tire markings. In addition to this, no matter how many times I re-mounted the new Continental tires, I could never get them evenly mounted. Thus, when I spun the tires, there were 5-10 millimeters of wobble in the tires, up-and-down and side-to-side. Not only did these mounting issues lead me to question Continental's quality control, but the wobble combined with the actual 47 mm width of the new Continental tires caused them aggressively rub the Dahon's fork while spinning. Unfortunately, the Dahon Classic's frame and fork were just too tight a fit the 1.75 inch Continental.

I decided to return the Continental tires and instead purchased a pair of 16 x 1.5 inch Schwalbe Marathon Racer tires that fit perfectly within the Dahon Classic frame and fork. The Schwalbe tire measures 41 mm wide when fully Inflated. There is a chance that I might have gotten away with a different brand of 1.75 inch width tires, particularly if they were undersized by the manufacturer. However, I didn't want to risk it. If you are feeling bold and want to attempt this, just beware. Without the Continental's wobble, the 47 mm width of the tire would have just barely fit between the Dahon's fork blades. The height of the tire would have been much more of an issue. The height of the Continental tire, when measured from the wire bead to the tallest point of the tire was 51 mm. This caused the tire to drag along the bottom edge of the front caliper brake. Consider yourself warned.

  Insert 3 images

  * side by side images of the original tire markings vs the new Schwalbes

Headset and fork
""""""""""""""""

I will need to update this article at a later date once I have taken the time to refurbish the headset on this bike. I plan to do so within the next year, so hopefully I'll have more info on this soon. In the meantime, there are some other online sources where owners have taken apart their headset assembly.

.. todo::

   * Describe fork and headset design
   * Provide link to more info on headset
   * I will update this section when I eventually refurb the headset

Cable routing
"""""""""""""
Cable routing for the Dahon Classic is not strictly prescribed. One of the tougher decisions I needed to make while refurbishing this bike was how exactly I wanted my brake and shifter cables routed. The only actual cable stop brazed onto the frame is the shifter cable stop located on the drive-side seat stay.  There is a second cable routing braze-on (albeit not a true cable stop) located off-center beneath the top tube. This second braze-on was the original stop-point for the rear brake cable housing. That stop was required with the original center-pull rear brake. However, if you choose to replace the centerpull rear brake with a sidepull brake caliper, then you no longer need to use this braze-on as a cable stop. Instead, you can use it as a means for routing your rear cable housing. With a little experimentation, I was able to find a suitable setup for my cable housing. The largest concern is that cables are routed in such a way, and with a sufficient amount of slack, that you can fold the bike without the cable housings pulling taught and binding.

.. todo::

  * add close up photos of cable related braze-ons
  * add photos with highlighted cable overlay lines
  * Discuss the amount of cable slack required for stem adjustment/removal and folding

Frame mounts, fenders, and other miscellanea
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. todo::

   * Discuss the other mounting points included on the frame
      * The stem tower reflector mount (and a cheap lighting solution)
      * The lack of fork eyelets and an easy workaround for the front fender stays
      * The small screw mount for the original chainguard
      * The rear seatstay cross-bracket for rack mounting
      * The rear eyelests for fender/rack mounting
   * Discuss fender replacement options (Brompton vs. others)

Wheel design and quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::

  * Discuss how hard it is to find replacement alloy rims, with the exception of Alibaba's marketplace
  * Also mention the steeply angled braking surface and the challenge it presents (as well as the poor brake grip in wet weather)
  * Discuss the o.l.d. for the front and rear hubs
  * Discuss the difficulty of finding replacement front hubs
  * Discuss the bearing sizes required

The stock wheels on this bike are made of steel. The hubs are steel. The spokes are steel. The rims are steel. As you would expect given that information, the wheels are heavy.

Stock rims
""""""""""

As is the case with most chromed-steel bike rims, the Dahon's steel rims:

* Are far heavier than a comparable double-wall aluminum alloy rim of the same size might be;
* Have braking surfaces that perform very, very poorly when wet (see the :ref:`breaking surface<braking-surface>` sub-section below for more detail).

These two traits put replacing these rims high on my to-do list for this bike. However, because (a) decent 305 mm alloy rims are difficult to come by and (b) I have no immediate need to replace the current hubs built into these wheels, I have put off rebuilding these wheels for the time being. If I were planning on ordering new rims for this bike, and because I would be interested in lacing them with the same current 28-hole hubs, I would likely be limited to ordering my rims from overseas merchants on Alibaba's `AliExpress marketplace <https://www.aliexpress.com/>`_. So far, I have been unable to find any domestic source for 28-hole 305mm alloy rims. The closest I have come are 20-hole and 24-hole 305mm Dahon Kinetix rims sold through `ThorUSA.com <http://thorusa.com/>`_. Major manufacturers, if they do have a 16-inch rim model, those are typically of the 349mm Brompton-sized variety. Even the manufacturer WTB, who appears to manufacture some of the current OEM 305mm rims used for Dahon's XXX model 16-inch folder, does not appear to even list those rims among the products on their company website.

As for the 305mm rims available on the `AliExpress marketplace <https://www.aliexpress.com/>`_, those appear to be limited to KinLin and LitePro K-fun rims, for which I can find no reviews nor manufacturer documentation online.

Additionally, the braking surfaces of the rim are steeply angled, meaning that most brake pads will make very poor contact with that surface.

   * Discuss the problem of seatpost slippage and getting a tight enough grip with the lower seatpost collet

Handlebar and stem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The original stem and handlebar for this bike are made of chromed steel. The extending post of the stem is roughly XX mm in diameter with XX mm of reach and a 25.4 mm clamp diameter. I am hesitant to call this a "quill" stem, because the post is a simple tube, rather than a traditional stem with an extending bolt. In order to tighten the stem into place, you use the quick release bolt at the top of the folding steer tube. To aid in the ability to easily slide the stem up and down, in order to make folding easier, there is a grooved plastic shim between the steer tube and the stem post, and the stem post itself has a grooved channel to match the shim. This groove and channel helps to keep the stem aligned to the front wheel. This helps to prevent the stem from shifting left to right while sliding it up and down.

The handlebar is a fairly narrow (XX mm end-to-end) flat bar with approx. XX degrees of sweep. This little bit of sweep does aid in wrist comfort versus a truly flat bar, but the molded hard plastic grips don't make for a very soft touch for the palms and fingers. Overall, it's not horrible, but I have never been a particularly big fan of flat bars, and I find them limiting to the amount of time I am willing to spend on a bike due to wrist and palm discomfort and eventual numbness in my fingers. For that reason, I knew from the beginning that I wanted to find an alternative handlebar setup; one that might offer multiple hand positions and be more comfortable on longer rides.

However, I never much cared for dropbars either. Plus, the vertical drop from a set of dropbars would also more likely interfere with with the folding mechanics of the bike based on a few initial experiments where I fitted the bike with a set of spare dropbars I had stored in the basement. I had always been somewhat partial to Nitto mustache bars, and the felt familiar because I had been riding a 1993 Bridgestone XO-1 fitted with a set for the better part of two decades. So, I thought I might try to find an alternative form of "mustache" bar with a bit less reach and perhaps curved to be a bit more comfortable on longer rides. Eventually I settled on the Porteur bars offered by Velo-Orange. These aluminum bars have a XX.X grip diameter, so that they can take hooded (i.e. road) brake levers, and the inner diameter at each end is XX.X mm, meaning that they are compatible with a bar-end shifter. Even better, they offer several hand positions, have less reach and less drop than the traditional Nitto mustache bars, and they sweepback further. All of these factors make for an overall familiar riding experience, but with more comfort in a slightly more relaxed riding position. The only real shortcomin is the overall width of the bars, which measure XX.X mm center-to-center, making them a more narrow than I'd like for a city commuting bike. But, nonetheless, they are still comfortable and serve their purpose well. 

I did initially attempt to replace the original steel stem with a traditional 1" diameter long-quill aluminum dirt drop styled stem for a more traditional look and to increase the reach of my riding position on this bike. To accomplish this, I found a low-cost Senqi quill stem with XX.X mm reach and an extra long quill that measured XX.X mm from clamp center to the quill's 'minimum insert line. Instead of the original plastic steer tube shim, I used a set of two aluminum shims to reduce the inner diameter of the steer tube column down from XX.X mm to 22.2 mm. This was accomplished by using a 25.4 mm to 22.2 mm shim nested within a XX.X mm to 25.4 mm shim. And, because the stem was secured using the steer column clam, rather than the wedge-shaped expander on the stem's quill, this approach worked very well for securing both shims and the stem itself. However, after several months of riding the Dahon with this alternative stem setup, I ultimately decided that the reach was a bit too far for my taste, and that I couldn't get the handlebars up quite as high as I wanted on this bike. Interestingly, this choice also coincided with an overall shift in my preferred riding position, and took place along side a larger push to improve comfort in my general riding position. Therefore, I swapped the long-quill dirt drop stem back out with the original short-reach steel stem, and couldn't be happier with my choice. Between my well-worn B17 Brooks saddle, the Velo-Orange Porteur bar, the increased handlebar height, and the reduced reach of the original stem, this bike is set up for very comfortable (and fast) distance riding.

Bottom bracket and cranks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are thinking about purchasing a new bottom bracket for a Dahon Classic frame, be aware of three very important things...

First, you will not be able to use a typical sealed cartridge bottom bracket with a sealed enclosure. The Dahon's seat tube passes through the frame's bottom bracket shell (see illustration below), meaning that you will need to use a traditional 3-piece cup and cone style bottom bracket. A sealed cartridge bottom bracket such as a Shimano BB-UN55 will not have sufficient room to pass through the bottom bracket shell. When I replaced the bottom bracket, I ended up using a 3-piece 1990's Shimano bottom bracket with english threaded cups with an 68 x 115 mm width spindle.

Second, it will likely be extremely hard to extract the original crank arms from the spindle. The original folding steel crankset that came with this bike had no threading in the recess near the crank bolt. That means you will not be able to thread a crank remover onto either crankarm in order to remove them. I ended up using a general purpose gear puller to remove the crankarms from the bottom bracket spindle. It wasn't particularly easy to do, but I was able to do it. Below is a photo of the gear puller I ended up using.

Once I was able to remove the crankarms and replace the bottom bracket, I decided to replace the steel folding crankarms with a lighter set of forged aluminum cranks. For this, I used an old Sugino XD 175mm crankset I had in my parts bin. This crankset had the same 110 mm bolt-center diameter (BCD), so it meant that I could reuse the original XX tooth steel chainring, and it provided a slightly larger Q-factor, allowing the crankarms to clear the dual-pivot sidepull brake I used to replace the original centerpull rear brake. 

Swapping out the original steel crankarms for these lighter Sugino XD cranks probably also struck me as the easiest way to reduced the overall weight of this bike. Swapping these out probably reduced the weight by close to 2 pounds. 

Third, not all classic Dahon frames of this era use 3-piece cranks. Some were manufactured for use with the cheaper 1-piece cranksets often found on the department store bikes of this era. The bottom bracket housing of those 1-piece cranksets are a different diameter and are too large for the use of a 3-piece bottom-bracket. One-piece to three-piece adapters do exist, but I have no experience with them (nor do I really have much experience with one-piece cranks), so some additional research will be required on this topic.

.. todo::

   * Discuss 3-piece crank vs. single-piece seen in some photos (add photos and links to other resources)
   * Draw and add illustration of the bottom bracket shell with seattube intrusion

Important specifications and measurements
-----------------------------------------

For useful reference, below is a table outlining the important measurements and specifications related to this bike frame:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Part
      - Measurement
      - Notes
    * - Wheel diameter
      - 16 x 1.75 (305 mm ISO)
      - The wheels are ISO 305 mm 16 inch wheels (i.e. decimal sized), not the slightly larger standard used on current Bromptons, which is ISO 349 mm (i.e. fractional sized). See `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_ for more details.
    * - Rims
      - 28-hole chromed-steel, XX mm external rim width
      - These rims have :ref:`an unusually steep angle to their braking surfaces<braking-surface>`, making brakepad replacement tricky.
    * - Tire clearance  
      - XX tire width
      - The original tires that came with this bike were labeled 16 x 1.75 (expected to be 45 mm), but their actual mounted width was closer to 16 x 1.50 (38 mm). Due to limited front fork clearance, I needed to use a modern 16 x 1.50 or 38 mm width tire.
    * - Front hub
      - 64 mm O.L.D., XX mm axle width, 28 spoke, cup and cone design
      - The front hub is made of steel. The fork spacing and hub over-lock-nut-distance (O.L.D.) is extremely narrow. The narrowest modern bike hubs I have seen are 74 mm (versus the standard 100 mm O.L.D), which is found on some ultra compact Bike Friday and Dahon models.
    * - Rear hub
      - 100 mm O.L.D., `Sturmey-Archer AW 3-speed`_, XX mm axle width, 28 spoke
      - The Sturmey-Archer rear hub is the classic AW 3-speed design with an oiling port and steel exterior hub casing. 
    * - Bottom bracket and spindle
      - English threaded cups with approx. 68 x 115 mm tapered spindle
      - A cup and cone style bottom bracket must be used. The seatube passes partially through the bottom bracket shell and prevents the insertion of a fully-encased sealed cartridge bottom bracket.
    * - Seatpost diameter
      - 33.9 mm lower-tube exterior (XX mm interior), XX mm upper-tube exterior (XX mm interior)
      - The upper and lower seaposts use plastic shims to make slide adjustments easier. The bike frame's vertical seat tube has an internal diameter of approximately 36 mm.
    * - Seat tube length
      - XX mm maximum effective length from the "max insert" line to the saddle rails.
      - The telescoping seatpost is made of chromed-plated steel tubing and the full length of the seatpost is XX mm fully extended, from the bottom of the seatpost to the saddle rails.
    * - Stem length
      - XX mm reach and XX mm from the "max insert" line to the center of the handlebar clamp
      - The adjustable stem is made of chrome-plated steel tubing and the full length of the stem is XX from the bottom of the tube to the top of the clamp. Similar to the seatpost, the stem also uses a plastic shim to make slide adjustments easier. The bike frame's vertical stem insertion tube has an internal diameter of approximately XX mm
    * - Stem clamp diameter
      - 25.4 mm
      - The stem clamp diameter is the ISO standard size for upright style handbars. 
    * - Rear brake
      - Centerpull with approximately XX mm available reach
      -
    * - Front brake
      - Side pull caliper with approx. XX mm available reach
      -
