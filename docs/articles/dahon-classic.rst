Rebuilding a 1980's Dahon Classic III
=====================================

*Published: 2020-01-28  ( Last revised on 2020-02-20 )*

Background
----------

I was recently given a 1980's Dahon Classic III folding bike. The friend who gave it to me had been given the bike by a friend of his who, in turn, had acquired it cheaply. However, after realizing how much a bike shop wanted to charge her to reburbish and tune the bike, my friend's friend had passed it on to him. My friend had no time to rebuild a bike, so he passed it on to me.

It has been several years since I've taken on a bicycle project. There was a period in my life when I'd refurbish a couple bikes a year. I had acquired a strange love for stripping bikes down to their bearings and rebuilding them into new configurations. I was never a cyclist in the sense that I loved to go road riding or mountain biking, but I loved biking for transport and I loved building and rebuilding bikes. My specialty was late-1980's to mid-1990's steel bike frames and cycling technology of that era.

When I received the Dahon Classic from my friend it provided me an opportunity to delve back into this hobby. It, importantly, also provided me an opportunity to stop contemplating whether it would be worth purchasing a folding bike that I might be able to (a) keep at the office for use on midday or after-work excursions or (b) pack into the car on road trips. However, if I'm being honest, I had been contemplating this folding bike question for more than a decade. I was well aware that I would never act on this curiosity unless the right project bike came along. So it goes, I ended up with this Dahon Classic III, and now I will see if it is worth the work it takes to rebuild.

A record of this bike's unique traits
-------------------------------------

While this article logs my rebuilding of this bike, my true motivation for writing this is to provide a record of the unique specifications, measurements, and idosyncracies of the Dahon Classic III. For a model of bike so common as this one (cheap used Dahons of this era are typically easy to come by and they even appear to have attracted a cult following in parts of Southeast Asia), clear documentation regarding this bike's unique specifications is very difficult to find on the Internet. I did come by some forum discussions indicating that this was not always the case, and that there was someone who at one point written extensively about this bike. But it sounded like this person's site pages had vanished from existence some time ago.

Wheels diameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The wheels of the Dahon Classic are 16 inch. However, as things typically go with bicycle wheel sizing, actual wheel size measurements, when expressed in inches, are open to interpretation. This bike's 16 inch wheels are of the "decimal" sizing variety. The original tires that came on this bike's rims were labeled 16 x 1.75. This means they had an ISO bead seat diameter of 305 mm. This is important to note, because as of my writing of this article (early-2020), 305 mm rims and tires are hard to come by. Far more plentiful are rims and tires made for the "16 inch" standard diameter used by Brompton folding bikes and many recumbant bikes. The Brompton's 16-inch wheels are of the "fractional" sizing variety. Therefore, a Brompton tire will read 16 x 1 3/8, and its ISO bead seat diameter will be 349 mm. From what I could gather while researching this topic, there was a time when the 305 mm diameter was more common on small-wheeled bikes, thus providing more choice among tires and rims. The 349 mm diameter wheel was a bit harder to come by and was typically used on higher-end and sportier folding bikes and recumbants. The 349 mm rims were typically narrower and were designed for narrower and higher pressure performance tires. As it goes, most modern folding bikes are now designed with 20 inch tires. While there are still some modern 16 inch folders using the 305 mm rim, they are few and far between, and the 16 inch market is largely dominated by Brompton and recumbants designed for the sportier 349 mm rim. I suspect that, if I had been working on this project as recently as the late-2000's, there would have been a wider variety of 305 mm tires and rims available.

For a little more background on wheel sizing standards, an article well worth reading (as are most of his articles) is `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_.

Important specifications and measurements
-----------------------------------------

For useful reference, below is a table outlining the important measurements and specifications related to this bike frame:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Part
      - Measurement
      - Notes
    * - Wheel diameter
      - 16 x 1.75 (305 mm ISO)
      - The wheels are ISO 305 mm 16 inch wheels (i.e. decimal sized), not the slightly larger standard used on current Bromptons, which is ISO 349 mm (i.e. fractional sized). See `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_ for more details.
    * - Tire clearance  
      - XX tire width
      - The original tires that came with this bike were labeled 16 x 1.75 (expected to be 45 mm), but their actual mounted width was closer to 16 x 1.50 (38 mm). Due to limited front fork clearance, I needed to use a modern 16 x 1.50 or 38 mm width tire.
    * - Front hub width
      - 64 mm o.l.d.
      -

bottom bracket shell: ~68mm, english thread, 117mm axle
front dropouts: 64mm o.l.d.
rear forks: 110mm o.l.d.
wheel diameter: 16x1.75 (305)
seat post: 33.9mm lower tube, ???mm upper tube, ??? frame interior
stem tube: ???mm tube, 25.4mm handlebar clamp
front brake: ???mm caliper reach
rear break: ???mm caliper reach
