Rebuilding a 1980's Dahon Classic Folder
========================================

*Published: 2020-01-28  ( Last revised on 2020-02-20 )*

Background
----------

I was recently given a 1980's Dahon classic folding bike. The friend who gave it to me had been given the bike by a friend of his who, in turn, had acquired it cheaply. However, after realizing how much a bike shop wanted to charge her to reburbish and tune the bike, my friend's friend had passed it on to him. My friend had no time to rebuild a bike, so he passed it on to me.

It has been several years since I've taken on a bicycle project. There was a period in my life when I'd refurbish a couple bikes a year. I had acquired a strange love for stripping bikes down to their bearings and rebuilding them into new configurations. I was never a cyclist in the sense that I loved to go road riding or mountain biking, but I loved biking for transport and I loved building and rebuilding bikes. My specialty was late-1980's to mid-1990's steel bike frames and cycling technology of that era.

When I received the Dahon Classic from my friend it provided me an opportunity to delve back into this hobby. It, importantly, also provided me an opportunity to stop contemplating whether it would be worth purchasing a folding bike that I might be able to (a) keep at the office for use on midday or after-work excursions or (b) pack into the car on road trips. However, if I'm being honest, I had been contemplating this folding bike question for more than a decade. I was well aware that I would never act on this curiosity unless the right project bike came along. So it goes, I ended up with this Dahon folder, and now I will see if it is worth the work it takes to rebuild.

A record of this bike's unique traits
-------------------------------------

While this article logs my rebuilding of this bike, my true motivation for writing this is to provide a record of the unique specifications, measurements, and idosyncracies of this 1980's Dahon folder. For a model of bike so common as this one (cheap used Dahons of this era are typically easy to come by and they even appear to have attracted a cult following in parts of Southeast Asia), clear documentation regarding this bike's unique specifications is very difficult to find on the Internet. I did come by some forum discussions indicating that this was not always the case, and that there was someone who at one point had written extensively about this bike. But it sounded like this person's site pages had vanished from existence some time ago.

Build experiences and important specifications
----------------------------------------------

To see a consolidated list of important specifications and measurements, you can jump to :ref:`the table <specs>` at the end of this article. Please note that I am not entirely certain of the year in which this bike was manufactured, and so far I have been unable to locate the serial number anywhere on this bike's frame. However, if the year stamped on the Sturmey-Archer AW 3-speed hub shell is any indication, I at least know that the rear hub was manufactured in 1987. The `1987 Dahon user's manual`_ available as a pdf through the Dahon.com website also shows images of a bike very similar to mine, with the exception of a few specific components, which may have varied based on model.

16-inch wheel sizing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The wheels of the Dahon Classic are 16 inch. However, as things typically go with bicycle wheel sizing, actual wheel size measurements, when expressed in inches, are open to interpretation. This bike's 16 inch wheels are of the "decimal" sizing variety. The original tires that came on this bike's rims were labeled 16 x 1.75. This means they had an ISO bead seat diameter of 305 mm. This is important to note, because as of my writing of this article (early-2020), 305 mm rims and tires are hard to come by. Far more plentiful are rims and tires made for the "16 inch" standard diameter used by Brompton folding bikes and many recumbant bikes. The Brompton's 16-inch wheels are of the "fractional" sizing variety. Therefore, a Brompton tire will read 16 x 1 3/8, and its ISO bead seat diameter will be 349 mm. From what I could gather while researching this topic, there was a time when the 305 mm diameter was more common on small-wheeled bikes, thus providing more choice among tires and rims. The 349 mm diameter wheel was a bit harder to come by and was typically used on higher-end and sportier folding bikes and recumbants. The 349 mm rims were typically narrower and were designed for narrower and higher pressure performance tires. As it goes, most modern folding bikes are now designed with 20 inch tires. While there are still some modern 16 inch folders using the 305 mm rim, they are few and far between, and the 16 inch market is largely dominated by Brompton and recumbants designed for the sportier 349 mm rim. I suspect that, if I had been working on this project as recently as the late-2000's, there would have been a wider variety of 305 mm tires and rims available.

For a little more background on wheel sizing standards, an article well worth reading (as are most of his articles) is `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_.

Tire sizing and clearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When I acquired this bike, it still had its original checkered pattern 16 x 1.75 Hwa Fong brand tires on it. When I inspected these tires, I could see clear cracking along the tread in both tires, so I decided to replace them with a modern pair of puncture resistent touring/commuting tires. This is when I learned just how few tire companies manufactured versions of their more popular tires in 305 mm sizing. After a good deal of research, I ultimately found myself trying to decide between the 16 x 1.75 versions of Continental's  Ride Tour city tire and Schwalbe's Marathon tire. Both seemed to get good reviews and both had characteristics I desired. So, to save some cash, I ordered the lower cost Continental brand tires. It turns out however, that the Hwa Fong 16 x 1.75 inch tires already on the Dahon were closer in size to 1.5 inches wide (41 millimeters to be exact) instead of the 1.75 inches indicated by the tire markings. In addition to this, no matter how many times I re-mounted the new Continental tires, I could never get them evenly mounted. Thus, when I spun the tires, there were 5-10 millimeters of wobble in the tires, up-and-down and side-to-side. Not only did these mounting issues lead me to question Continental's quality control, but the wobble combined with the actual 47 mm width of the new Continental tires caused them aggressively rub the Dahon's fork while spinning. Unfortunately, the Dahon Classic's frame and fork were just too tight a fit the 1.75 inch Continental.

I decided to return the Continental tires and instead purchased a pair of 16 x 1.5 inch Schwalbe Marathon Racer tires that fit perfectly within the Dahon Classic frame and fork. The Schwalbe tire measures 41 mm wide when fully Inflated. There is a chance that I might have gotten away with a different brand of 1.75 inch width tires, particularly if they were undersized by the manufacturer. However, I didn't want to risk it. If you are feeling bold and want to attempt this, just beware. Without the Continental's wobble, the 47 mm width of the tire would have just barely fit between the Dahon's fork blades. The height of the tire would have been much more of an issue. The height of the Continental tire, when measured from the wire bead to the tallest point of the tire was 51 mm. This caused the tire to drag along the bottom edgeThe Dahon's caliper brake. Consider yourself warned.

Seatpost and shims
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handlebar and stem

Bottom bracket and cranks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When dissase If you are thinking about purchasing a new bottom bracket for a Dahon Classic frame, be aware of two very important things...

First, you will not be able to use a typical sealed cartridge bottom bracket with a sealed enclosure. The Dahon's seat tube passes through the frame's bottom bracket shell (see illustration below), meaning that you will need to use a traditional 3-piece cup and cone style bottom bracket. A sealed cartridge bottom bracket such as a Shimano BB-UN55 will not have sufficient room to pass through the bottom bracket shell. When I replaced the bottom bracket, I ended up using a 3-piece 1990's Shimano bottom bracket with english threaded cups with an 68 x 115 mm width spindle.

Second, it will likely be extremely hard to extract the original crank arms from the spindle.

Important specifications and measurements
-----------------------------------------

For useful reference, below is a table outlining the important measurements and specifications related to this bike frame:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Part
      - Measurement
      - Notes
    * - Wheel diameter
      - 16 x 1.75 (305 mm ISO)
      - The wheels are ISO 305 mm 16 inch wheels (i.e. decimal sized), not the slightly larger standard used on current Bromptons, which is ISO 349 mm (i.e. fractional sized). See `Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing`_ for more details.
    * - Tire clearance  
      - XX tire width
      - The original tires that came with this bike were labeled 16 x 1.75 (expected to be 45 mm), but their actual mounted width was closer to 16 x 1.50 (38 mm). Due to limited front fork clearance, I needed to use a modern 16 x 1.50 or 38 mm width tire.
    * - Front hub
      - 64 mm O.L.D., XX mm axle width, XX spoke, cup and cone design
      - The front hub is made of steel. The fork spacing and hub over-lock-nut-distance (O.L.D.) is extremely narrow. The narrowest modern bike hubs I have seen are 74 mm (versus the standard 100 mm O.L.D), which is found on some ultra compact Bike Friday and Dahon models.
    * - Rear hub
      - 100 mm O.L.D., `Sturmey-Archer AW 3-speed`_, XX mm axle width, XX spoke
      - The Sturmey-Archer rear hub is the classic AW 3-speed design with an oiling port and steel exterior hub casing. 
    * - Bottom bracket and spindle
      - English threaded cups with approx. 68 x 115 mm tapered spindle
      - A cup and cone style bottom bracket must be used. The seatube passes partially through the bottom bracket shell and prevents the insertion of a fully-encased sealed cartridge bottom bracket.
    * - Seatpost diameter
      - 33.9 mm lower-tube exterior (XX mm interior), XX mm upper-tube exterior (XX mm interior)
      - The upper and lower seaposts use plastic shims to make slide adjustments easier. The bike frame's vertical seat tube has an internal diameter of approximately 36 mm.
    * - Seat tube length
      - XX mm maximum effective length from the "max insert" line to the saddle rails.
      - The telescoping seatpost is made of chromed-plated steel tubing and the full length of the seatpost is XX mm fully extended, from the bottom of the seatpost to the saddle rails.
    * - Stem length
      - XX mm reach and XX mm from the "max insert" line to the center of the handlebar clamp
      - The adjustable stem is made of chrome-plated steel tubing and the full length of the stem is XX from the bottom of the tube to the top of the clamp. Similar to the seatpost, the stem also uses a plastic shim to make slide adjustments easier. The bike frame's vertical stem insertion tube has an internal diameter of approximately XX mm
    * - Stem clamp diameter
      - 25.4 mm
      - The stem clamp diameter is the ISO standard size for upright style handbars. 
    * - Rear brake
      - Centerpull with approximately XX mm available reach
      -
    * - Front brake
      - Side pull caliper with approx. XX mm available reach
      -
