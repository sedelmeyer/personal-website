<p>Hello. My name is Mike Sedelmeyer. I have tackled growth and performance challenges in operations, finance, services, technology, and sales in organizations as diverse as the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>, <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.emc.com/" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a> (now DELL EMC).</p>

<h3>My Unusual Career</h3>

<p>I began my career as an artist. I was born and raised in Upstate New York and was in college studying painting at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a> when I traveled west and then north for a summer <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyfisherysalmon.main" target="_blank">commercial fishing in Alaska</a>. This experience left me with a taste for adventure. After completing college and after a short stint as a <a href="http://www.thecraftsman.com/" target="_blank">furniture maker in Syracuse</a>, I traveled west again and spent five years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire" target="_blank">fighting forest fires for the U.S. Federal Government</a>. During this time I wintered back east with my wife (New Orlean and later Upstate New York) until I followed her permanently (and all year round) to Cambridge, Massachusetts. There I spent several years working in higher ed. management (and as a teaching assistant in statistics) at Harvard University. I eventually enrolled in graduate school at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>, where I studied business, public policy and innovation to earn both an <a href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/" target="_blank">MBA</a> and <a href="https://www.masspolicy.org/" target="_blank">MPPA</a> degree. This led to my work in operations and systems at <a href="https://www.jstart.org/" target="_blank">Jumpstart</a>, a national non-profit based in Boston, my work in finance at <a href="http://www.ford.com" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a> in Dearborn, Michigan, and my subsequent several years at <a href="https://www.emc.com/en-us/services/professional-services/index.htm" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a>, a global technology firm now owned by Dell Technologies, supporting strategic operational programs and eventually managing the companyâ€™s consulting business for two global financial services customers in New York City.</p>

<h3>Right Now</h3>

<p>My wife and I have returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts after a year living in New Jersey and working in New York City. I am currently taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones before I begin my next adventure.</p>

<h3>About this Website</h3>

<p>This site is a work in progress. I am building it using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/Jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll parsing engine</a> and learning HTML, CSS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank">YAML</a>, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid Template Language</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, and a little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> along the way.</p>

<p>Check back. I will be adding more to this site over the upcoming weeks.</p>
