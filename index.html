<p>Hello. My name is Mike Sedelmeyer. I have tackled growth and performance challenges in finance, operations, and technology in organizations as diverse as the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Land Management</a>, <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.emc.com/" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a> (now DELL EMC).</p>

<p>I combine my experience in finance, program management, business analysis, and consulting to help guide organizations toward improved operations and more effective decision-making.</p>

<p>I am currently taking several months off to spend time with family and to pursue personal projects.</p>

<p>You can find my resume on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedelmeyer/" target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a>.  {% include icon-linkedin.html %}</p>

<h3>An Unusual Career Path</h3>

<p>I grew up in upstate New York. I was in college studying painting at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank">Syracuse University</a> when I traveled west for a summer of <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyfisherysalmon.main" target="_blank">commercial fishing in Alaska</a>. This experience left me with a taste for adventure. After college I traveled west again and spent five years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire" target="_blank">fighting forest fires for the U.S. Federal Government</a>. During those five years I spent my winters with my wife in New Orleans and later upstate New York until I followed her permanently to Cambridge, Massachusetts. There I spent several years working for Harvard University, both administratively and as a teaching assistant in statistics. I eventually enrolled in graduate school at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>, where I earned dual <a href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/" target="_blank">MBA</a> and <a href="https://www.masspolicy.org/" target="_blank">Public Policy</a> master's degrees. This led to my work in operations and systems at <a href="https://www.jstart.org/" target="_blank">Jumpstart</a>, a national non-profit based in Boston, my work in finance at <a href="http://www.ford.com" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a>, and my several years at <a href="https://www.emc.com/en-us/services/professional-services/index.htm" target="_blank">EMC Corporation</a>, a global technology firm now owned by Dell Technologies, where I supported strategic programs and eventually managed the companyâ€™s consulting business with two financial industry global customers in New York City.</p>

<h3>Right Now</h3>

<p>My wife and I have returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts after a year living in New Jersey and working in New York City. I am currently taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones before I begin <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/future">my next adventure</a>.</p>

<p>A couple things keeping me busy right now include:
  <ul>
    <li>Documenting family history and <a href= "https://github.com/sedelmeyer" target="_blank">building custom tools with Postgres, Flask, and Python</a> to manage my genealogical data and archive files, and</li>
    <li>Improving my proficiency with Python and R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Strange But True Facts</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I am good with a chainsaw and have experience felling trees 36+ inches in diameter.</li>
  <li>I can strip a bicycle down to its frame and bearings and rebuild it part-by-part.</li>
  <li>I spent a year rappelling out of helicopters during my work as a wildland firefighter.</li>
</ol>
