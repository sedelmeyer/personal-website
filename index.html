<h3 id="mike">About Me</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/fidel_mask.jpg" alt="me" width="175" height="175">
<p>Hello. My name is Mike Sedelmeyer. I have a broad set of skills and experiences tackling growth and performance challenges in operations, finance, services, technology, and sales.</p>

<p>I began my career as an artist and then a summer commercial fishing in Alaska led me down a different path. I spent five years fighting forest fires in the western United States. I returned east and worked in higher ed. management at a Harvard University. I went to graduate school and studied business and public policy. I have since worked for a national non-profit, a global automaker, and a global technology firm.</p>

<h3>Right Now</h3>
<p>I am currently taking several months off to write, work on projects of my own, and spend time with friends and loved ones.</p>

<h3>This Website</h3>
<p>This site is a work in progress. I am building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and learning HTML, CSS, YAML, Liquid, Markdown, Javascript, and a little bit of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="blank">Ruby</a> along the way.</p>
<p>Check back. I will be adding more to this site over the upcoming weeks.</p>
